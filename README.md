# Shapebattalica
This is a project inspired by a challenge I've found online, and is building upon some of the SFML basics I tested out [here.](https://github.com/ThamasMc/shapelandia)

Additionally, I'm usually partial to working fully within a terminal, but for this go I wanted to try switching things up and using Visual Studio.

With my work present in the initial commit, the original challenge goals are met, and I'll be building upon the engine here as I go to expand and experiment with its architecture.
